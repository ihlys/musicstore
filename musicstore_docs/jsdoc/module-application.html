            <div class="description"><p>This is the main module of application which represents all javascript code.
Webpack takes this file and generates single application.bundle.js in
root/static folder. All pages have only one &ltscript&gt tag which loads this
file. When page is loaded by browser if this script was loaded previously than
it is picked from browser cache, otherwise it is loaded into memory.
<p>This is a single page application. Each view page can be loaded
synchronously or asynchronously. When client makes initial request, view page
is fully rendered and loaded synchronously. In such case script reads value
from it's tag data attribute with name <code>'data-initial-page-init'</code>,
which corresponds to name of the page and it's initialization function. Script
waits until document is ready and automatically executes this function.
Initialization function initializes all widgets, adds custom listeners, adds
styles to html elements and so on. For asynchronous page loading, when there is
already loaded current page and another is needed, this module exports a
<a href="module-application.html#.loadPage">module:application.loadPage</a> function, which can be used in custom user
events like button click and so on. When page is loaded asynchronously, only
it's "#main__content" part is rendered and this part is substituted into
initially loaded page.
<p> This design is used because of single page application approach to
switching pages in application. Each page has one shared set of elements such
as header, footer and so on, and a "#main__content" element which is an actual
page. User can switch pages asynchronously without needing of javascript
sources update. When next page content is loaded, it's javascript is already
loaded in memory and only it's components must be initialized which
initialization function does.</div>

<div class="description">
    <p>Sends an XMLHttpRequest for loading a page and renders it's content into
"#main__content" element, after which executes a corresponding
initialization function. It has an internal mapping of url addresses to
page names, which are also used as names of initialization functions.
<p>Additionally, if loaded content contains element with
"<code>music-info</code>" class, that is there is a selected music entity,
then it hides element with class "<code>menu</code>", otherwise
shows it.
